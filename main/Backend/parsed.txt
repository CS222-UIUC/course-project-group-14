Introduction.
This is a ﬁrst course in linear algebra. This covers
basic deﬁnitions and algorithms of the subject
needed in the higher level (engineering, science
and economics) courses and more sophisticated
mathematical techniques such as the Singular
Value Decomposition.
In this course you learn the mathematical theory
and how to implement it in Python. You will dis-
cover many of the striking modern applications
of linear algebra, such as Google’s PageRank al-
gorithm, image and audio compression schemes
such as JPEG and MP3, automatic face recogni-
tion and other data science and machine learning
algorithms.
The course covers the same mathematical theory
as MATH 415, but adds a focus on the compu-
tational and large data aspect of linear algebra
through the lab sessions.
Technical equipment. Many aspects of this course will be conducted online. As
such, each student will be assumed throughout the semester to have the necessary
technical equipment to participate in course activities:
/volume_upa computer/laptop/tablet with a webcam and a microphone,

MATH 257 Linear Algebra with Computational Applications 2
/volume_upa stable internet access, suﬃcient bandwidth and data allowance for using
a webcam on Zoom.
Please contact the Student Assistance Center (helpdean@illinois.edu) immediately
if you are missing any of required technology.
Other Linear Algebra courses. Be aware that course credit is not given for both
MATH 257 and any of MATH 125, MATH 225, MATH 227, MATH 415, MATH 416
or ASRM 406. Any enrollment related questions should be sent to mathadvis-
ing@illinois.edu.
Three disclaimers.
/warning_signThis is not a course that only teaches you how to compute stuﬀ. Computer
will always be faster. Modern applications of linear algebra require a sophis-
ticated understanding of theory and methods of linear algebra, and learning
these is the purpose of this course. Some of it might look like abstract linear
algebra. However, through the applications we cover in the labs, you realize
that this indeed is applied linear algebra.
/warning_signIf you already know some linear algebra, this course might look easy at the
beginning. Don’t be fooled into thinking it will stay like that. Even the ma-
terial familiar to you will be covered in more depth here. Furthermore, the
exams will require a deeper understanding of the concepts you already know
something about. So it is a good idea to take this course seriously from the
beginning .
/warning_signThis is only the second oﬃcial large-scale oﬀering for MATH 257. A signiﬁ-
cant part of the material for this new course is - not surprisingly - new. So if
you ﬁnd a typo or an error in any part of this course, please let us know by
sending an email to the instructors. We appreciate your help, and are also
happy to hear any further comments or suggestions. Thank you!
Learn@Illinois. This course has a page on Learn@Illinois:
https://learn.illinois.edu/course/view.php?id=69673
All material will be available there or linked from there. Please note that if you
have just registered for the course, you will automatically be given access to the
Learn@Illinois website within a few hours. Only if you do not have access to the
course site 48 hours after registering, then contact your instructor.
COVID. University COVID-19 policies are in eﬀect for the semester. Please review
the relevant policies at
https://covid19.illinois.edu/guides/students/
andbe sure to be in compliance with university policies .
Setup. This course consists of two hours per week of lecture, one hour per week of
computing lab, and one hour per of week of active learning (paper-based) discussion
sections.

MATH 257 Linear Algebra with Computational Applications 3
Discussion section. Discussion sections are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays with
the detailed schedule available at Course Explorer:
https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2022/fall/MATH/257
Only attend the discussion section you are signed up for. No credit is given otherwise.
During the discussion sections, TAs will distribute worksheets to be completed col-
laboratively in small groups. At the end of the period, each group will submit
one worksheet. Complete solutions to the worksheet will be posted afterwards on
Learn@Illinois.
Attendance will be taken. You will be given a password at the beginning of each dis-
cussion section and you will have 15 minutes to mark yourself present on Learn@Illinois.
Note that it is not enough to just be present. You have to be actively working with
your group, and the worksheet submitted by your group must show that your group
put in the necessary eﬀort. If this is not the case, we will not consider you present
and you will not receive points for participation. All students in a group receive
the same amount of participation credit on the worksheet. The maximum score for
each week is two points (one for attendance and one for participation).
Computational Lab. Labs are held synchronously online on Zoom on Fridays. The
times are available on Course Explorer, but please see the Labs document under
the Course Information tab on Moodle for details including Zoom Meeting IDs and
passwords. Please only attend the lab sections you are signed up for. No credit is
given otherwise.
In the labs you will use computational tools in Python to solve linear algebra prob-
lems in real world applications in science and engineering. You will be working in
small groups on a Python worksheet together. Though the ﬁrst lab session is a
Python tutorial, students are assumed to have prior experience in Python or
be able to familiarize themselves quickly to Python. Students without the req-
uisite programming background have struggled to complete the course.
Attendance will be taken. You will be given a password at the beginning of each lab
and you will have 5 minutes to mark yourself present on Learn@Illinois. Note that
it is not enough to just be present. You have to be actively working with your group
on the project. If this is not the case, we will not consider you present.
Textbook. We will post extensive lecture notes for all lectures and practice prob-
lems online. For many students these notes are enough. If you still want to
buy/download a book, here are some options (several of them free!) in no particular
order.:

You are not required to buy any of these textbooks. Please note the coverage and
order of topics for these resources may diﬀer from our course.
Lectures and Slides. Lectures are twice weekly on Mondays and Wednesdays. You
are expected to read the lecture notes and/or watch the lecture videos before attend-
ing the in-person lectures. The in-person lecture times will focus on reviewing the
concepts introduced in the lecture notes and providing further examples.
Lecture notes are on Learn@Illinois. An interactive version with ﬁll-in boxes is
also available.
Videos. We will post module videos on the Learn@Illinois page of this course. An
interactive version of the slides with ﬁll-in boxes is also available. If you would like
to use this feature, print out the ﬁll-in slides and ﬁll them out on your own or while
watching the videos. Video errata may be found at the video link on the Moodle
page under the appropriate week’s tab.
There are many other great (free) videos about linear algebra. Here are some we
recommend as an addition (not a substitute) for the lecture videos.
/facetime_videoEssence of Linear Algebra by 3Blue1Brown, on Youtube, highly recommended
/facetime_videoMIT lectures by Gilbert Strang, MIT Open Courseware
/facetime_videoCoding the Matrix videos by Philip Klein, on Youtube
Online homework. Each module comes with two sets of homework. All are open-
notes and you may collaborate with other students:
The Moodle module quizzes each consists of two to three conceptual questions. You
only have one attempt for each quiz. Be sure to spend some time thinking over the
material in the module before attempting the quiz. Since these are conceptual ques-
tions, precision is important so read the lecture notes and the questions carefully.
The PrairieLearn homework comes in two forms: lab and non-lab. The non-lab
homework associated with each module provides opportunity to practice the com-
putations and algorithms covered in the module. In this homework you will have
to do the computation we did in the video by yourself. The lab homework is based
on the most recent Friday Python lab activity. See below for more information on
PrairieLearn. This course is listed in PrairieLearn as follows:
MATH 257: Linear Algebra with Computational Applications, MATH 257 - Fall
2022
Either of the above two types of assessments in the ﬁrst two weeks of the semester
will not count towards the ﬁnal grade due to changing enrollments during that
period.
Workspace/help sessions. We reserved the room 1060 Lincoln Hall (1LH) Mondays
to Thursdays 5-7pm. See the Oﬃce Hours tab on Moodle for details. At least one
TA will be present during this time to answer your (non-Python related) questions.

MATH 257 Linear Algebra with Computational Applications 5
You don’t have to come to the room only if you already have a question. You can
just go there and work—either alone or with your fellow students. We will highly
recommend that you form study groups and make use of this room! The room will
be open during the ﬁrst week, but the TAs will start being there in Week 2.
For Python-related questions, undergraduate course assistants (CAs) will hold
online oﬃce hours via Zoom throughout the week starting Week 2. See the Moodle
course page for details.
Weekly assignment schedule. Regular weekly assignments due dates are as fol-
lows:
/_558Moodle Quizzes (covering modules from current week), due Thursdays 11:59PM
(except on weeks with midterms, due following Monday 11:59PM instead)
/_558PrairieLearn (non-lab) Homework (covering modules from previous week),
due Tuesdays 11:59PM at 100% (see below)
/_558PrairieLearn lab Homework (covering lab from previous week), due Thurs-
days 11:59PM.
For example, the Moodle quizzes for Week 1 are due on Thursday 08/25 (Thursday
of Week 1). PrairieLearn Week 1 non-lab homework is due (at 100%) on Tuesday
08/30 (Tuesday of Week 2).
Netiquette. Since this course has a substantial online component, please be re-
spectful of your fellow classmates and teaching staﬀ in all online communications.
Fostering a helpful learning environment requires everyone’s cooperation. Remem-
ber that forum posts are visible to all students and staﬀ in the course (over 700
people). So please double-check your posts before submitting them.
PrairieLearn. We will use PrairieLearn for homework. See the Quick links at the
top of the course Moodle page.
(Non-lab) Homework (at 100%) will be due on Tuesdays at 11:59PM. The ﬁrst home-
work is due on Tuesday 08/30 of Week 2. The PraireLearn homework will lean
towards computations, while the Moodle quizzes and the worksheets in the discus-
sion section will focus more on conceptual problems.
How points are given on PrairieLearn. PrairieLearn places emphasis on mastery.
The idea is to keep doing questions until you master the underlying concept or
method. Once you do, you should be able to answer these questions very quickly.
The way this works in PrairieLearn is that each question has a value, a point total,
and a point maximum. If you answer a question correctly, two things happen:
/playThe point total increases by the value, until you reach the point maximum.
/playThe value increases.
If you answer a question incorrectly, one thing happens:
/playThe value goes back to what it was originally.
This system rewards repeated correct answers, which tend to demonstrate mastery.
There is no penalty (other than resetting the value) for answering a question incor-
rectly, so don’t be afraid to submit an answer. Similarly, don’t be afraid to keep doing

MATH 257 Linear Algebra with Computational Applications 6
a question after you reach the point maximum - your point total with never go down!
Credit. There is no need to “submit” your homework. The system will record what-
ever your score is at that time. However, you’ll note the following line at the top of
your screen:
Available credit: 110% until 11:59PM, Fri, 08/26
What this means is that if you reach 100% prior to 11:59PM on that Friday - i.e.,
complete the homework early - you will receive an extra 10% bonus. You will see
this reﬂected in your score (the instant you reach 100%, it will jump to 110%).
If you click on the “?” just to the right of the line about available credit, you’ll see
all the dates associated with this homework. In particular, it says:
/playyou can receive 100% until 11:59PM, Tuesday, 08/30,
/playyou can receive 80% until 11:59PM, Tuesday, 09/06.
Note that your score will never go down. For example, if you achieve 90% by 11:59PM
on Tuesday, 08/30, you won’t be able to increase your score after that time, but you
won’t be penalized for not reaching 100% - your score will remain 90% forever. On
the other hand, if you achieve only 70% by 11:59PM on Tuesday, 08/30, you will
be able to increase your score after that time (to a maximum of 80%).
Please note that your overall PrairieLearn score is capped at 100%. So even if you
score 110% on every assignment, you will only receive 100% overall. The bonus is
designed to help oﬀ-set homeworks where you may not have received full credit.
Lab Homework (at 110%) will be due on Thursdays at 11:59PM. The ﬁrst lab home-
work is due on Thursday 09/01 of Week 2. Unlike the non-lab homework, the lab
homework will only be oﬀered at 110% and 80%.
Any changes to regular homework deadlines for either type will be announced on
CampusWire.
Typos/Errors. If you believe there is a typo or an error in a question, or if you
believe your answer was graded incorrectly, please take a screenshot and post to
CampusWire. We have access to all of your submissions and can check to see what,
if anything, went wrong.
CampusWire. All announcements will be posted on CampusWire at
https://campuswire.com/p/G3D3A7589
Please make sure you are signed up for CampusWire . The registration PIN is
available under the Quick links at the top of the Moodle course page. When post-
ing on CampusWire, please use the subject line wisely and post in the appropriate
category. For example, if you ask something about matrix multiplication in Lecture
notes 5, write “Lecture notes 5 - Matrix multiplication” and not just “Question about
matrices”. In addition, please post to the entire class whenever this is appropriate.
No question will ever be held against you.

MATH 257 Linear Algebra with Computational Applications 7
Because of the large number of students (700+) and the limited number of teaching
staﬀ, please help us facilitate response times by observing the following:
Please post all content questions and those of general interest regarding
course material or organization to CampusWire rather than via email. Multi-
ple course staﬀ monitor CampusWire, and this allows all students to beneﬁt
from both the question and our reply.
For questions about the scoring of your assignment (quizzes, labs, exams,
etc.) please post on CampusWire using the option “Post to instructors and
TAs” when posting.
Forprivate questions regarding special cases of course policy (e.g. DRES,
absence from an exam, etc.) please use email and copy the relevant teaching
staﬀ (e.g. TA, lab TA, or course instructor). Please clearly indicating your
lecture/discussion/lab sections in the email subject. We aim to have response
times for emails generally in one or two business days.
Syllabus Quiz. Because of the online format for this course, familiarity with course
policies will be essential. All students will be required to complete by 11:59PM
Friday of Week 3 (September 9) a syllabus quiz on Learn@Illinois. This quiz covers
basic course policies. It is open-notes and unlimited attempts are allowed.
Exams. There will be three midterm exams, each about 50 minutes long, and a
three hour ﬁnal exam. Students register with CBTF for an exam slot during the
below speciﬁed tentative windows. Details regarding administration of the ﬁnal
exam will be announced later in the semester.
/_388Midterm 1: Week 4, 09/13-09/15
/_388Midterm 2: Week 8, 10/11-10/13
/_388Midterm 3: Week 11, 11/01-11/03
/_388Final: TBA.
Students are responsible to ensure they are properly registered with CBTF and
sit for their exam at their registered time. There will be no make-up exams.
Instead, if you miss an exam and have a valid excuse, we will mark the exam as
‘excused’. (see ”Grading” below for details) Valid excuses must be documented
and must be reported to your instructor immediately (no later than the same day
as your CBTF midterm registration). There are no Friday Python labs on the weeks
with midterms.
CBTF. This course uses the College of Engineering Computer-Based Testing Facility
service CBTF Online for its exams:
https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu
The policies of the CBTF are the policies of this course, and academic integrity in-
fractions related to the CBTF are infractions in this course.
If you have accommodations identiﬁed by the Division of Rehabilitation-Education
Services (DRES) for exams, please upload your Letter of Accommodations (LOA) to
the CBTF site: https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students/dres before you make your ﬁrst
exam reservation (at least ﬁve business days prior).

MATH 257 Linear Algebra with Computational Applications 8
If you have any issue during an exam, please inform the proctor or relevant CBTF
staﬀ immediately. Work with the proctor to resolve the issue at the time before log-
ging oﬀ. If you do not inform a proctor of a problem during the test, then you forfeit
all rights to redress.
Review all instructions on the CBTF website before your ﬁrst exam:
https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/cbtf-online/index.html
Cheating. No books, notes, cheat sheets or electronic devices are allowed during
the exams except a non-graphing scientiﬁc calculator. We take cheating very seri-
ously! A more detailed description of the University policy on cheating and plagia-
rism may be found in the following link:
http://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity/
Grading. The course grade will be a weighted average of the following assessments:
/play2% syllabus quiz
/play5% discussion section attendance/completion (the two lowest weekly com-
bined scores will be dropped)
/play5% lab attendance & completion (the two lowest scores of each will be dropped
and the two categories weighted 33%+67% respectively)
/play8% PrairieLearn (non-lab) homework (the two lowest scores will be dropped)
/play5% PrairieLearn lab homework (the two lowest scores will dropped)
/play2% Moodle module quizzes (the six lowest scores will be dropped)
/play17% each Midterm exam (total 51%)
/play22% ﬁnal exam
In addition: If your ﬁnal exam score is higher than one of your midterm scores, then
we will replace your lowest midterm score by your ﬁnal exam score.
If you miss one midterm ( and have a valid excuse ), we will use the average of the
two other midterms and the ﬁnal exam as the score for the midterm you missed.
We then apply the above calculation (including the potential replacement of your
lowest midterm score).
If you miss more than one midterm and have a valid excuse for each absence, please
contact your instructor.
Letter grades will be assigned according to (this is for the percentage, not for the
absolute score!):
/play100.00 % - 98.00 % !A+
/play97.99 % - 93.00 % !A
/play92.99% - 90.00% !A-
/play89.99 % -87.00 % !B+
/play86.99 % - 83.00 % !B
/play82.99 % - 80.00 % !B-
/play79.99 % - 77.00 % !C+
/play76.99 % - 73.00 % !C

MATH 257 Linear Algebra with Computational Applications 9
/play72.99 % - 70.00 % !C-
/play69.99 % - 67.00 % !D+
/play66.99 % - 55.00 % !D
/play54.99 % -0.00 % !F
Usually around 30% of the students in comparable courses get an A letter grade
(including +/-) and around 70% score a B letter grade or higher. The median score
is usually between 83% and 84%. We anticipate this course to have similar statis-
tics.
We will renormalize each of the midterms and ﬁnal exam such that the distribu-
tion of letter grades coincides with this historic distribution of the letter grades. No
further curve will be applied at the end of the course.
In particular, there will be no individual extra credit opportunities after class in-
struction ends and closed assessments do not reopen. So make sure to work hard
for every assessment!
Please check each week that your scores were entered correctly on Learn@Illinois.
With so many students it can happen that your grade is entered incorrectly. If, after
an assessment, you ﬁnd an error in the grading, please contact course staﬀ imme-
diately via CampusWire or before or after class/discussion section or during our
oﬃce hours. It can always happen that we made a mistake, so we always encourage
you to see us if you think that happened. Except for exams, rescoring requests will
only be considered within a week of the assessment due date. For exams, rescoring
requests will only be considered within a week of the posting of exam scores. So don’t
wait!
With more than 700 students there are always many cases where students are close
(sometimes even very close) to the next letter grade, and at the end of the semester
make the case that they should receive higher grades. Unfortunately, in almost all
cases we can not grant the request without being unfair to other students—even if
we would like to!

LING 490 Project Proposal
Hate Speech Detection System
Group
: Ariane Taraki, Erik Ly, Aditi Khanna
‚óè
Goal (Problem definition and importance)
‚óã
What am I going to do?
Our group plans to build a system to detect hate speech (sexism and racism) within text,
specifically in this case, tweets. Using an already existing annotated dataset, we plan to build
our system by training and testing multiple ML models and doing error analysis on the
respective results.
‚óã
Who would benefit?
It is understood that much of hate speech is ill-defined in the linguistics community.
Despite this, we believe our system could be used as starting place for detecting and flagging
racist and sexist hate speech in text, specifically within social media platforms (i.e. Twitter in this
case). By doing this, one would be able to detect when a social media environment is fostering
hate speech, thus providing an opportunity to combat the speech in general to help create a
more inclusive community. Additionally, our error analysis will be useful for other researchers in
the field for determining how different ML models work when used in the system.
‚óè
Problem Difficulty
‚óã
Why is it hard?
We anticipate that this may be difficult because we are not very familiar with the
applications of various traditional and deep learning ML models, and this is a key aspect of our
project. We will have to train these models properly on the existing dataset, decide on which
features to test for each model, test within the data, and analyze the results in our error
analysis. When interpreting the results, we will have to come together and accurately assess not
only the performance of our models, but also why these results came to be.
‚óã
How hard is it?
This project is moderately difficult, as we will have to intake a lot of data (16k+ tweets),
create our models and train/test them in application to this data. Despite this, since we have
many resources to base our system on, this should not be too difficult to achieve. We anticipate
the hardest part being our error analysis, when having to accurately assess our model results.
Overall, this should be feasible for our group, but still somewhat challenging.
‚óè
Previous Work [this bullet point is NOT mandatory now, but recommended]
‚óã
What have others tried?
This project uses data gathered in
Hateful Symbols
or Hateful People? Predictive
Features for Hate Speech Detection on Twitter
from
researchers Zeerak Waseem and Dirk
Hovy. The
dataset
was created from a model that served
to detect racism and sexism within
tweets submitted by users from the Twitter API. Additionally, this approach to a hate speech
detection system is detailed as an Old Project for this class, which we are attempting to
extrapolate on (delving deeper into model comparison and analysis).

‚óè
Approach
‚óã
What approach am I going to try?
We will first use the tweet
data set
from
Hateful
Symbols or Hateful People? Predictive
Features for Hate Speech Detection on Twitter
by Zeerak
Waseem and Dirk Hovy as the
foundation for our work. We will gather these tweets by parsing the Twitter IDs in question from
the Twitter API, storing them for usage alongside their annotated categorization (‚Äúsexism‚Äù,
‚Äúracism‚Äù or ‚Äúnone‚Äù). This data will then be used for training and testing on our Machine Learning
models. Features and other specifics of our ML modeling system are to be determined, however
we do plan to use some similar and different features for each model to be able to conduct a
more in-depth error analysis. For our error analysis, we plan to compare the resulting
performance of our models, as well as why we believe the performance differences exist or do
not exist.
‚óã
Why do I think it will work well?
We are confident that our system will work well as we have a lot of data and existing
research to check our accuracy against and glean from. Additionally, we believe that by using
multiple ML models and comparing them to each other, we should be able to detect how the
models perform and conclude why. As long as we are able to successfully train and test our
models, we should be able to complete proper error analysis.
‚óè
Methodology
‚óã
What resources (e.g.: data, annotations, etc.) are required and how am I
going to get them (unless I already have them)?
The resources we need for this project include the dataset of 16k+ tweets that we will be
using to train our model and run our script upon. This can be found at:
https://github.com/zeeraktalat/hatespeech
. This dataset
includes tweet IDs, associated with their
annotated hate speech (‚Äúsexism‚Äù, ‚Äúracism‚Äù, or ‚Äúnone‚Äù). The tweet content themselves will be
gathered from the Twitter API.
‚óã
What computational models do I have in mind to solve the problem?
We are currently still in the discussion phase of which specific ML models we plan to use
on our system, currently we believe we may use the traditional Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and
Linear Regression models . We may decide to substitute one of these traditional models for a
deep-learning model instead, for better error analysis and performance comparison based on
the context of our project. A supervised learning approach makes sense for our project as well.
‚óã
Which aspects of your model(s) are particularly hard?
We believe that using these models successfully, and interpreting their results will be a
challenge for our group. Traditional models (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Linear Regression)
have challenges with datasets as slight or drastic variations from the original dataset can lead to
these models being unable to perform. If we decide to do more difficult deep-learning models,
we will have to implement a Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) to allow the machine to make a
connection of what is hate speech from
hatebase.org
.

.
‚óã
What to do if the hard steps don't work out (meaning, what is my plan B)?
If we are unable to properly use a ML model, our backup plan would be to substitute that
model out for one we understand better (i.e. substitute a deep learning model with a traditional
one). Additionally another backup would be to utilize other machine learning models such as SK
Learn to evaluate our system. If no ML models end up working, a last case resort would be to
compare model effectiveness using resources and research on the models that already exist.
If our dataset serves to be a problem with respect to training the models, our plan B
would be to create a dataset ourselves from the already existing one with a different annotation
schema containing features for easier evaluation. This might be difficult, but due to the fact that
we already have an existing dataset, we would just have to build upon that data using a script to
detect the hate speech within the tweets, possibly annotating them with level of offensiveness
(from
hatebase.org
) or other features gathered from
additional data sources.
‚óè
Metrics
‚óã
How will I measure success?
We plan to measure the success of our project by determining if we are able to
successfully test and train our chosen models on the data, and conduct error/performance
analysis on the results. We would deem those models themselves to be successful if they reach
over a certain performance result threshold for precision, accuracy, and F1 scores (specific
threshold to be determined).
‚óè
Summary
‚óã
Why is this project of interest to me and what will I learn by doing this
project?
As regular users of social media, we have all seen the amount of hate comments and
sexist/racist speech on platforms such as Twitter. This project is interesting in that it allows us to
create a system that could potentially filter out these hateful comments. In the process, we get
to learn about how to build effective models using ML and compare our results to current similar
state-of-the art projects. We will also learn how to work together on a project of this size,
working on our own but also coming together to evaluate our combined results.
‚óè
Split of Work
We plan to evenly split up the work for our project three ways. We all plan to contribute
towards organizing and parsing the dataset for ML usage. All three of us will be in charge of
training and testing one ML model using similar processes. For our current traditional models in
mind, the split would work as follows (these are not set in stone): Aditi in charge of the Naive
Bayes model, Ariane in charge of the Decision Tree model, and Erik in charge of the Linear
Regression model. We plan to come together and fairly discuss our results and observations
from using our respective models. The resulting analysis will thus be split evenly and serve as
our model error analysis. By splitting the work in this way (each being in charge of a ML model),
we are able to utilize our three-person group to the best of our advantage, maximizing analysis
efficiency.

We will consider these works as representative of their historical periods, as well as their relevance for the world we live in today. This course is necessarily broad, covering a long history in a short stretch of time; but we will also delve deeply into the individual texts, films, and other works of art that we encounter. These distinct but related aimsócoverage of a long history; close attention to specific textsówill be reflected in the writing assignments. These will include structured close reading assignments, as well as looser, more personal reflections on the sweep of the course. If the first type of assignment asks for sustained, intense analysis of a single passage of a single work, the second encourages you to draw connections between various works. Through these assignments, this course fulfills the Advanced Composition requirement. But beyond that, we hope youíll find specific authors and larger movements and historical eras you may want to learn more about.  Assignments & Grading  There will be 8 total writing assignments. 6 of these will be short (500-600 words), and 2 will be longer (1000-1200 words). The short assignments will be due more or less every two weeks (see the schedule below). These will each offer a choice of responding to 2 specific passages (we will offer 4 to choose from) in the form of close readings, or of doing a more creative response. However, you 

may choose the ìcreative optionî only once in each half of the semester. So, in each half of the semester, you will do at least 2 assignments of close reading, and 1 other short assignment of your choice: either another close reading or the creative option (see specific assignments on the schedule below).  All writing assignments will be graded only as ìpassî (which means 100/100 in the Moodle gradebook) or ìrevise.î To achieve a pass, each piece of writing will need to meet three specific requirements:  ï It should be turned in on time ï It should be within the required word limits ï And it should engage substantively with the text or texts to which it is responding  To elaborate these points:  Due dates: all writing assignments are due on Fridays by midnight (i.e., the end of Friday); but there is an automatic, built-in extension of 48 hours, which is until Sunday at midnight. Papers turned in after Sunday at 11:59 and 59 seconds will receive a 5-point deduction for every day it is late after that  Word limits: close readings should each be 250-300 words (for a total on each assignment of 500-600); longer assignments are 1000-1200 words  Substantive engagement: close readings should explain each passage on a number of levels. A good close reading would do all of the following:  ï Identify where the passage came from ï Situate the passage within the work from which it is drawn ï Explain what the passage means ï Show how it exemplifies larger themes or concerns of the text (or of the course more broadly)  Substantive engagement on the creative projects is more subjective. If you have questions about how to engage with course materials in a creative response, please ask your TA, or drop by the professorís office hours (see above for contact info).   The three primary criteria (on time, right length, substantive engagement) apply to the longer writing assignments as well, and all papers will be graded on the same ìpassî or ìreviseî basis. Papers meeting all three criteria will pass and receive 100/100 in the Moodle gradebook. If a paper does not meet the criteria, your TA will ask you to revise it and resubmit by a specified date. Late papers (submitted after Sunday at midnight, or after the date specified for a revision) will receive a 5-point deduction for every day they are late.    

Longer Papers  The longer writing assignments are described below on the schedule. Both of these papers can be considered forms of substantial revision of the work youíve done on the shorter papers. As youíll see below, for the longer papers we will ask broad but pointed questions as a prompt for you to rethink, revise, extend, and connect the ideas youíve developed in the short papers into coherent reflections on the larger sweep of what weíve covered. The general criteria and rules for grading are the same as for the short papers.  Final Grades  In this course, we will be grading via what is called ìcontract grading.î What this means is that if you meet certain criteria we guarantee a certain grade. The details are as follows:  ï If you turn in all the writing assignments in accordance with the criteria specified above, you will earn at least a 90/100 for the course ï If you meet the first criterion AND do your best to demonstrate substantive engagement, not only on the writing assignments, but in the life of the class, you will earn at least a 95/100 for the course ï Substantive engagement means, primarily, active participation in your discussion sections, but there are other ways to be engaged. If speaking in class is not your favorite thing, talk to your section leader about other ways to get active. ï Grades may drop below 90/100 for the following reasons only: ï Excessive and repeated lateness on assignments and revisions (see policy on grading papers above) ï Active disruption of lecture or section  Technology & Communication  There is a Moodle Site for the course. The site includes any readings in PDF form (see schedule below), slides for the lectures, and links for submitting writing assignments.   We will communicate with you via email, sometimes directly from our University of Illinois email accounts, and sometimes via the Moodle email function. Please check your University of Illinois email account at least twice a day, as there may be important updates to assignments and alerts about class meetings (this is especially crucial given the uncertainties regarding the pandemic). If you need to communicate with any of us, please do so via University of Illinois email. This is the only form of communication we will use.  The Pandemic  Speaking of the pandemic: we hope to remain in person for the duration of the semester. However, we know that conditions may change, and we will follow whatever guidance we receive from the university. That guidance currently includes the following: if you have not yet been vaccinated against Covid-19, please do so. If you have been vaccinated, but have not yet received a booster 

shot, please get a booster as soon as possible. Vaccines are free and widely available, and they have been proven to provide excellent protection against severe disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus, especially the new Omicron variant, is extremely contagious, and we hope that we can all work together to prevent transmission as much as possible. In addition to vaccination, this means wearing a high-quality protective mask that covers your mouth and your nose when weíre gathered together indoors. As recent guidance from the university suggests, cloth masks are not especially effective at preventing transmission, and we encourage you to find high-quality masks like N95s, KN95s, or KF94s. The university is providing one mask to every student on campus, and we encourage you to pick yours up, if you havenít done so. If you would like to purchase quality masks for yourself, they are available at places like Loweís and Costco. If youíre looking for a reputable purveyor online, you might consider https://www.projectn95.org/.   In addition to vaccines and masks (worn at all times when we are together indoors, and worn so that they cover your mouth and your nose), we will also be asking for your patience and flexibilityóand we will certainly do our best to be patient and flexible ourselves. Itís hard to know what direction this thing will go, but we may have to pivot occasionallyóif only temporarilyóto online instruction. This could be because of university-wide instructions, or because of contingencies with respect to individual instructors or even whole sections.  Even if we remain in person, we understand that this is going to be an unpredictable and difficult semester for everyone. Please reach out to any of us if you are struggling, or if there is anything we can do to make this semester a little easier, a little more tolerable.

F 5/6 Eighth and Final Writing Assignment Due: ï The story of the 20th and 21st centuriesóat least as it has unfolded in what weíve read and seen here in classólooks a little grim. If in some ways this era can be framed as a story of progress (especially in terms of technology and economic development), that progress seems to have left us on the brink of various interrelated catastrophes, from the nuclear threat to climate change. And these are, of course, themselves bound up with the longer histories of imperial warfare and capitalist globalization weíve been discussing from the beginning. For the final writing assignment, consider this question: What does it mean for you to be living in this modern world on the verge of crisis? Think about this question specifically in relation to the materials weíve encountered throughout the semester. How have these readings (and films and other works) helped you to understand how weíve arrived at this particular historical situation? And (if they have), in what ways have they helped you to imagine possible futures beyond our present crises? We hope youíll consider this essay as an invitation to write a sort of intellectual autobiography of the semester, reflecting on what youíve learned, what youíll take away from these readings, and what they help you imagine for the future. While we are inviting you to write in a personal register, please also remember to discuss, in some detail, at least three of the works weíve covered in the second half of the semester. And, as with the midterm paper, we encourage you to draw on what youíve written already: revising, expanding, and connecting the ideas youíve developed in your shorter papers into a longer, coherent reflection on the course.

B).  The advertisement uses the fact ive verb ìbelieveî alongside ìcanítî to presup pose that the product 
is very much,  if not  identical, to the taste and feel of butter despite being a  healthier alternative.  It 
asserts that it is not butter, though very similar.  
C).  Question  Test : ìCan you beli eve itís not butter? î allows the presupposition that the product is very

## Project Description
Every semester, students receive syllabi from every class with a multitude of information about grades, resources and dates. To help students manage their schedules, SyllaBestie goes through your syllabus and instantaneously outputs a calendar file with all the important dates to remember, which can be instantly imported into popular calendar platforms like Google Calendar and Apple Calendar.  Our motivation for creating SyllaBestie was to streamline the process of finding important dates for classes.  Many students (especially new freshman) struggle with keeping track of assignment dates for multiple classes throughout the semester.  Furthermore, not all classes import due dates and assignments onto Canvas or Moodle, and nobody likes constantly sifting through the syllabus to check when assignments are due.  With SyllaBestie, this process can be avoided because all due dates can be instantly transcribed into your digital calendar for increased visibility through your computer and phone!

## Project Description
Every semester, students receive syllabi from every class with a multitude of information about grades, resources and dates. 
To help students manage their schedules, SyllaBestie goes through your syllabus and gives you a calendar file with all the 
important dates to use on popular calendar platforms like Google Calendar and Apple Calendar.

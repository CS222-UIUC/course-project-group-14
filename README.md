## Project Description
Every semester, students receive syllabi from every class with a multitude of information about grades, resources and dates. To help students manage their schedules, SyllaBestie goes through your syllabus and instantaneously outputs a calendar file with all the important dates to remember, which can be instantly imported into popular calendar platforms like Google Calendar and Apple Calendar.
